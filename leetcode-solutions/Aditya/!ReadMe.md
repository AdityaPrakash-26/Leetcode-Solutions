This ReadMe will explain about the files in my folder.

I cannot create multiple symbols for each problem I attempt. Each C++ file has an `int main()` function, which causes duplication. To work around this, I have marked only `!Executable.cpp` as executable.

Hence, I am including(using #include) the relevant problem files in `!Executable.cpp` to run it. If you are aware of a better work-around, please open an issue and let me know! :)
