This Read Me file explains about the code in my folder. Note that other users may follow their own programming paradigm. Kindly refer to the Read Me (if any) in their folder for more specific instructions.

I cannot create multiple symbols for each problem I attempt. Each C++ file has an `int main()` function, which causes duplication. To work around this, I have marked only `!Executable.cpp` as executable.

Hence, I am including(using #include) the relevant problem files in `!Executable.cpp` to run it. If you are aware of a better work-around, please open an issue and let me know! :)
