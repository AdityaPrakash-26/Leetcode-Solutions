This is a repository for my friends and I for peer-coding starting April 7th. Our aim is to solve a thousand questions on Leetcode, within 6-8 months.

We wish to improve our competitve coding skills, and for this, we have decided to use github to review each other's code. If you think the code for any problem can be improved, please open an issue and let us know!
